# linalg
After a recent bout with spatial transcriptomics using python, I thought I would look into writing my very own extension module. This seems like a good opportunity to see what all the fuss is about with Rust.

Before jumping straight into the deep end, I intend to practice my rust by writing a module for general linear algebra functions.
